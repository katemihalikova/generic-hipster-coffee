    <h1>Our story</h1>
    <p class="lead">GHC started as a project of two friends and passionate baristas, John & Don in 2010. Believing as much in the hand of an
    educated barista as in the innovative equipment of the our ever-growing industry, GHC offers a full spectrum of brewing
    opportunities â€“ from pour overs to syphon pots to finely executed espresso beverages. Each cup of coffee is made with
    love, precision and care.</p>
